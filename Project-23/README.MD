# Project-23: Arduino Inclinometer using MPU6050
## Problem Statement
Build a Digital Inclinometer which can be monitored using an Android application.
## Description
The MPU6050 is an IC 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope combined into one unit. It also houses a temperature sensor and a DCM to perform a complex task. The MPU6050 is commonly used in building Drone and other remote robots like a self-balancing robot.

Once the code is uploaded, launch the Android application on your mobile phone. The application should automatically connect to your HC-06 module and it will display “Connect to: HC-06” on the top of the application

Initially, all the values will be zero except for the temperature value. This is because the Arduino has calibrated the MPU-6050 for this position as a reference, now you can tilt the hardware and check that the values on the mobile application are also changing along with the animation.
