# Project-6: Smartphone Accelerometer controlled car
## Problem Statement
Making a car using an Arduino and other components which can be controlled using the accelerometer sensor of a smartphone.
## Components
* 4 DC motors
* 4 wheels
* Arduino
* HC-05 Bluetooth Module
* L298 motor driver
* Android smartphone
* chassis
* wires
## Description
The  Android  app  downloaded sends  accelerometer  sensor  data  to  the Bluetooth module. 

We can write a code which can take input from the Bluetooth module and send  appropriate  outputs  to  the  motor  driver  modules  so  that  the  car moves according to the orientation of the smartphone.
## Steps
Connecting the Bluetooth module correctly to the Arduino and install the correct library for the Bluetooth module.

Connecting the Arduino to the driver module to the right pins (according to the code written).

Connecting the driver module to the motors.

Attach  the  motors  to  the  chassis  and  then  attach  the  wheels  to  the motors.

Keep the other components on the chassis and tape it securely.

Download  an  android  app  (eg. Arduino  Bluetooth  Control)  which  sends accelerometer data to the Bluetooth module.
