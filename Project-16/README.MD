# Project-16: Gesture Controlled Arduino based Air Mouse
## Problem Statement
Control the cursor of a computer using a mouse which is gesture controlled.
## Components
* Arduino Nano
* Accelerometer ADXL335 Module
* Bluetooth HC-05 Module
* Python Installed computer
* Push Buttons
## Description
we will use an accelerometer to get the value of the acceleration of the actions and motions of the “Air mouse” along the x and y-axis, and then based on the values of the accelerometer we will control the mouse cursor and perform certain actions with the help of the python software drivers running on computer.
## Personal Comments
* Learnt how the ADXL335 Module communicates and how to connect it.
* Learnt how the Bluetooth module transfers data to the Computer.
* These commands need to be run before running the pythin script:
```
pip install serial
pip install pyautogui
```
