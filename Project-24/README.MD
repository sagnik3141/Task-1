# Project-24: Generating Tones by Tapping Fingers
## Problem Statement
Generate tones by Tapping your fingers on anything conductive and create your own rhythms, its like playing Piano on your palm.
## Description
The project uses a total of four sensor, that is two flex sensor and two Darlington pairs acting as a touch sensor. We have also used two pull down resistors R1 and R2 of value 10k each, which will act as a pull down resistor for the Flex sensor. Here Flex sensor is used to generate Three different tones by using one finger, based on how much it has bent. So we can produce 6 sounds using two fingers.
## Personal Comments
Learnt how to make and use a Darlington Pair and how to work with a flex sensor.
