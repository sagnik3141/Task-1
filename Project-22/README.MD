# Project-22: Speedometer using Arduino and Processing Android App
## Problem Statement
Make a speedometer for bikes or any automotives by using Arduino which broadcast the speed using Bluetooth to an Android application.
## Description
A Hall Sensor is a component that detects the polarity of a magnet. To measure the speed we have to stick a small piece of magnet onto the wheel of the vehicle, each time the magnet crosses the hall sensor it will detect it and sends the information to the Arduino.

This information is then sent to the smartphone app using the HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
## Personal Comments
Learnt how a hall sensor works and how that data is transferred to a smartphone using the Bluetooth Module.
