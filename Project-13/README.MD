# Project-13: People in Space
## Problem Statement
Creating a gadget that tells you how many people are living on the ISS.
## Description
For this project, weâ€™re going to use the People in Space API to get data about the number of people in ISS and light up those many number of LEDs.

In this project, we use LEDBarGraph because we want to use the LEDs like a bar graph to show the how many astronauts are in space.
```
leds = LEDBarGraph(17, 18, 27, 22, 23, 24, 10, 25, 9, 11)
```
## Personal Comments
I learnt the following through this project:
* What APIs are, and how they can be used to provide data services to users and developers
* What JSON is, and how it can be used to exchange data between languages and applications
* How to access a web API using the Python requests module
